Programmer: Havish Chowdhry
Desc: Let's suppose you have the following three 2D arrays named Worker, Bonus, and Tile with the given data.
There is one common column i.e. Worker_ID in all these arrays.
TASK: Write a â€˜C' program for each of the following tasks:
a. Display the details of the workers having a maximum salary for each department.
b. Fetch departments along with the total salaries paid for each of them.
